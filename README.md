# Real Time Bus Tracker

Project Title: Real Time Bus Tracker

Description: A coding assignment dealing with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS languages, while also using Mapbox library for mapping purposes. I used a map of the campuses of MIT and Harvard and adding in an animated marker on the map to highlight the bus route by using the MTBA bus data to determine exactly where the stops occur.  To complete this tracker we had use access tokens from Mapbox to render maps on the webpage, and then create a marker using the pre-built Mapbox global functions.  This task had the learning outcomes of rendering a map on a webpage and learning different ways to manipulate the map.  

How to Run: To run the Real Time Bus Tracker on your machine you must first download the index.html, mapanimation.js, and styles.css files onto the same folder on your local machine.  Next, open the index.html file on your machine and push the “Show stops between MIT and Harvard” button to show the location of the bus stops with the marker.  

Roadmap of Future Improvements: Would like to improve this bus tracker to have a real time bus image at the location of the actual busses.  Also, improving the project to estimate times that the bus will get to each stop would be more helpful.
