Coding Assignment dealing with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS languages, also using Mapbox library for mapping purposes

Title of Project: Real Time Bus Tracker
Description of Project: Coding assignment dealing with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS languages that also used API and Mapbox library to help create a visual marker on the map at each of the campus bus stops between MIT and Harvard.  We were required to create a Mapbox account and get an access token, then add that access token into the JavaScript file.  Then created a marker and added it to the map using prebuilt functions.  Then we created a function called move() that allows the marker to become animated and move from stop to stop after a given set of time.

How to Run:  This project is not hosted by a web server, but you can run the project using the browser window of the local machine.

Roadmap to Future Improvement: I would like to be able to get information on bus stop times, and other markers to add in an actual animated bus and its real time location compared to the stops.  This would allow for an estimated arrival time at each bus stop as well.
